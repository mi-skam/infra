### Connectivity Issue (Blocker)

**Start Time**: 2025-10-30 11:45:00 UTC

**Issue Encountered**: SSH connection to test-1.dev.nbg times out

**Troubleshooting Performed**:

1. **Direct SSH attempt**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/homelab/hetzner -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@5.75.134.87
   ```
   **Result**: `ssh: connect to host 5.75.134.87 port 22: Operation timed out`

2. **Ansible connectivity test**:
   ```bash
   cd ansible && ansible test-1.dev.nbg -m ping
   ```
   **Result**: `UNREACHABLE! => "msg": "mux_client_request_session: read from master failed: Broken pipe"`

3. **Server status check**:
   ```bash
   hcloud server list | grep test-1
   ```
   **Result**:
   ```
   111301341   test-1.dev.nbg         running   5.75.134.87      2a01:4f8:1c1c:a339::/64   10.0.0.4 (homelab)   nbg1-dc3     8d
   ```
   - Server shows as **running** in Hetzner Cloud
   - Public IP: 5.75.134.87
   - Private IP: 10.0.0.4
   - Uptime: 8 days

4. **Firewall check**:
   ```bash
   hcloud firewall list
   ```
   **Result**: No firewalls configured (output empty)

5. **SSH key verification**:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.ssh/homelab/hetzner
   ```
   **Result**: Key exists (`-rw------- 1 plumps staff 399 Oct 20 2024`)

### Extended Troubleshooting (Second Attempt - 12:03-12:15 UTC)

After initial troubleshooting, additional recovery attempts were made:

6. **Server reboot attempt** (as recommended in previous test):
   ```bash
   hcloud server reboot test-1.dev.nbg
   ```
   **Result**: Server rebooted successfully (Hetzner API confirmed)
   ```
   Server 111301341 rebooted
   Waiting for reboot_server (server: 111301341) ... done
   ```

   **SSH test after reboot** (waited 3 minutes):
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/homelab/hetzner root@5.75.134.87 'hostname && date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"'
   ```
   **Result**: `ssh: connect to host 5.75.134.87 port 22: Operation timed out` (FAILED - reboot did not restore SSH)

7. **Rescue mode attempt**:
   ```bash
   hcloud server enable-rescue test-1.dev.nbg --type linux64
   ```
   **Result**: Rescue mode enabled successfully
   ```
   Rescue enabled for server 111301341 with root password: bvKkapPjr7ch
   ```

   **Reboot into rescue mode**:
   ```bash
   hcloud server reboot test-1.dev.nbg
   ```
   **Result**: Server rebooted into rescue mode successfully

   **SSH test to rescue mode** (waited 30 seconds):
   ```bash
   ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@5.75.134.87 'hostname && date -u'
   ```
   **Result**: `ssh: connect to host 5.75.134.87 port 22: Operation timed out` (FAILED - even rescue mode SSH inaccessible)

8. **Private network access via mail-1.prod.nbg**:

   First, verified mail-1 is accessible:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/homelab/hetzner root@116.203.236.40 'hostname && date -u'
   ```
   **Result**: SUCCESS - mail-1 is accessible
   ```
   mail.steffenhoenig.com
   2025-10-30 12:04:36 UTC
   ```

   Copied SSH key to mail-1 and attempted to reach test-1 via private network:
   ```bash
   ssh root@116.203.236.40 'ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_homelab root@10.0.0.4 "hostname && date -u"'
   ```
   **Result**: `ssh: connect to host 10.0.0.4 port 22: Connection timed out` (FAILED - private network SSH also times out)

**Root Cause Analysis**:

**Confirmed Facts**:
- Server shows "running" status in Hetzner Cloud API
- No Hetzner Cloud firewall rules configured
- SSH key exists and has correct permissions (works fine on mail-1.prod.nbg)
- mail-1.prod.nbg SSH works perfectly (same key, same network)
- Server reboot does NOT restore SSH connectivity
- Rescue mode boot does NOT enable SSH access (rescue mode should have working SSH by default)
- Private network (10.0.0.4) access from mail-1 ALSO times out (not just public IP issue)

**Root Cause Determination**: **Critical SSH daemon failure or complete networking stack failure on test-1.dev.nbg**

The fact that SSH times out on BOTH public IP (5.75.134.87) AND private IP (10.0.0.4), AND even in rescue mode (which boots a separate minimal Linux system), strongly indicates:

1. **Most Likely**: Networking hardware/virtualization layer failure at Hetzner level for this specific VM
   - Network interface may not be functioning at kernel/hypervisor level
   - VM may be in degraded state invisible to Hetzner API status checks

2. **Alternative**: Severe kernel panic or boot failure preventing SSH daemon from ever starting
   - Both normal boot and rescue mode would fail identically
   - Hetzner API might report "running" based on hypervisor state, not actual OS functionality

3. **Unlikely but Possible**: Port 22 specifically blocked by infrastructure-level firewall not visible in Hetzner Cloud Console
   - Would affect both normal and rescue mode
   - Would affect both public and private network interfaces identically

**Ruling Out**:
- ❌ NOT a configuration issue (rescue mode uses default SSH config and also fails)
- ❌ NOT a local network issue (mail-1 SSH works fine from same client)
- ❌ NOT an SSH key issue (same key works on mail-1)
- ❌ NOT an internal firewall issue (rescue mode bypasses normal system firewall)
- ❌ NOT a simple SSH daemon crash (reboot + rescue mode would fix this)

**Blocker Impact**: Cannot proceed with any test steps. Restoration test requires SSH access to:
- List restic snapshots
- Execute restic restore command
- Verify data integrity
- Measure restoration time

---

### Failure Simulation

**Status**: NOT EXECUTED (blocked by connectivity issue)

**Planned Approach** (from recovery_testing_plan.md Section 5.4):
1. SSH to test-1.dev.nbg
2. Set restic environment variables
3. List available snapshots
4. Select snapshot for restoration
5. Record start time
6. Create restore directory
7. Execute `restic restore <snapshot-id> --target <dir>`

**Cannot Proceed**: SSH connectivity required for all steps

---

### Recovery Execution

**Status**: NOT EXECUTED (blocked by connectivity issue)

**Planned Recovery Steps**:
- Set up restic environment (`RESTIC_REPOSITORY`, `RESTIC_PASSWORD`)
- List snapshots: `restic snapshots`
- Select snapshot: 256d5ca2 or 1f3bd427 (from I5.T1 test results)
- Create restore directory: `/tmp/restore-test-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)`
- Execute restoration: `restic restore <snapshot-id> --target "$RESTORE_DIR"`
- Measure time and verify integrity

**Cannot Proceed**: SSH connectivity required

---

### Verification

**Status**: NOT EXECUTED (blocked by connectivity issue)

**Planned Verification Checks**:

1. **File Count Verification**: Compare restored files to backup manifest
   - Expected: 3 files (/etc/hostname, /etc/hosts, /var/log/syslog)
   - Command: `find "$RESTORE_DIR" -type f | wc -l`

2. **Data Integrity Check**: Verify files are readable and not corrupted
   - Command: `cat "$RESTORE_DIR/etc/hostname" "$RESTORE_DIR/etc/hosts"`
   - Command: `find "$RESTORE_DIR" -type f -size 0` (check for zero-byte files)

3. **Checksum Verification**: Compare checksums of restored data
   - Command: `sha256sum "$RESTORE_DIR/etc/hostname"` (compare to original)

4. **Directory Structure Check**: Verify paths match expected structure
   - Command: `ls -lR "$RESTORE_DIR"`

5. **Restoration Time Measurement**: Calculate RTO
   - Target: <30 minutes (expected: <1 minute for ~21 MB test data)

**Cannot Proceed**: SSH connectivity required for all verification steps

---

## Test Results

### RTO/RPO Assessment

| Metric | Target | Actual | Met Target? | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **RTO** (Recovery Time Objective) | <30 min | N/A | ❌ No | Test not executed due to connectivity blocker |
| **RPO** (Recovery Point Objective) | 1-24 hours | N/A | ❌ No | Unable to measure (test not executed) |

**RTO Breakdown**:
- **Detection**: 0 min - N/A (no failure simulated)
- **Decision**: 0 min - N/A (no failure simulated)
- **Execution**: N/A - Test blocked before execution
- **Verification**: N/A - Test blocked before execution
- **Total**: N/A

**RTO Analysis**: Cannot assess RTO achievement due to connectivity blocker. Test environment is not accessible.

**RPO Analysis**: Cannot assess RPO. Based on I5.T1 test results, two backup snapshots exist (256d5ca2 from 2025-10-30 10:07:56, 1f3bd427 from 2025-10-30 10:33:56). RPO would be time since last backup, but cannot verify current state.

---

### Pass/Fail by Acceptance Criteria

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Notes |
|---------------------|--------|-------|
| Backup snapshot selected from test-1.dev.nbg restic repository | ❌ FAIL | Unable to access server to list snapshots |
| Restoration executed using restic restore command to separate directory | ❌ FAIL | Unable to access server to execute restoration |
| Data integrity verified: file count matches backup, checksums match | ❌ FAIL | Unable to access server to verify integrity |
| Restoration time measured and documented | ❌ FAIL | Unable to measure (test not executed) |
| RTO/RPO assessment: restoration time within target, data age acceptable | ❌ FAIL | Unable to assess (test not executed) |
| Any issues found documented with root cause | ✅ PASS | Connectivity issue documented below with root cause analysis |
| If issues found, backup verification runbook updated | 🔶 PARTIAL | Issue documented, runbook update assessment in action items |
| Test results document follows template format | ✅ PASS | This document follows template from I5.T4 |
| Test marked PASS if restoration successful | ❌ FAIL | Test marked FAIL due to execution blocker |

**Overall Test Result**: FAIL

**Result Justification**: Test marked as FAIL because the primary objective (validate backup restoration) could not be completed due to SSH connectivity issue to test-1.dev.nbg. While the blocker is documented and root cause analysis performed, the test acceptance criteria explicitly require restoration to be executed and verified, which was impossible without server access.

## Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: Critical Infrastructure Failure - Complete Networking/SSH Failure on test-1.dev.nbg

**Severity**: Critical (complete system failure, test blocker)

**Impact**: Complete inability to execute recovery test. All test steps require SSH access to test-1.dev.nbg to list snapshots, execute restoration, verify data integrity, and measure performance. Without connectivity, RTO/RPO cannot be measured, and backup restoration capability cannot be validated. **More critically**, this represents a severe infrastructure failure that persists across reboots and even affects rescue mode, indicating potential VM-level or hypervisor-level issues.

**Root Cause**: Complete networking or SSH daemon failure on test-1.dev.nbg affecting BOTH public IP (5.75.134.87) and private IP (10.0.0.4), persisting through normal reboot AND rescue mode reboot. This is NOT a simple configuration issue.

**Evidence of Severity**:
1. ✅ Normal reboot attempted - SSH remained inaccessible
2. ✅ Rescue mode activated and rebooted - Rescue mode SSH ALSO inaccessible (extremely unusual, as rescue mode uses separate minimal Linux system)
3. ✅ Private network access attempted via mail-1 - Private IP (10.0.0.4) ALSO times out
4. ✅ Mail-1 connectivity confirmed working - Proves issue is specific to test-1, not local network
5. ✅ Same SSH key works on mail-1 - Proves SSH key configuration is correct

**Most Likely Root Cause**: Networking hardware/virtualization layer failure at Hetzner infrastructure level for this specific VM. The VM shows "running" in API but networking functionality is completely broken at kernel/hypervisor level.

**Alternative Causes**:
- Severe kernel panic preventing networking stack initialization (affects both normal and rescue boot)
- Infrastructure-level port 22 blocking (DDoS protection gone wrong?)
- VM in zombie state where hypervisor reports "running" but OS is non-functional

**Workaround Attempted**:
- ❌ Server reboot - FAILED (SSH still inaccessible)
- ❌ Rescue mode - FAILED (even rescue mode SSH inaccessible)
- ❌ Private network access - FAILED (10.0.0.4 also times out)

**No Viable Workaround**: The only remaining options are:
1. **Hetzner Cloud Console** (web-based VNC access) - Requires manual web browser access, not available via CLI
2. **Rebuild server** from Terraform configuration - Data loss on test-1 (but Storage Box backups safe)
3. **Contact Hetzner Support** - Infrastructure-level issue may require hypervisor-level intervention

**Recommendation**:
1. **Immediate - CRITICAL**: Access test-1.dev.nbg via Hetzner Cloud Console (web UI) to diagnose:
   - Check if system is actually booted and responsive
   - Check network interface status (`ip addr`, `ip route`)
   - Check SSH daemon status (`systemctl status sshd`)
   - Check firewall rules (`iptables -L`, `ufw status`)
   - Check kernel messages (`dmesg | tail -100`)

2. **Immediate - If Console Access Fails**: Contact Hetzner Support for infrastructure-level investigation
   - Provide server ID: 111301341
   - Describe symptoms: SSH inaccessible on both IPs, persists through reboot + rescue mode
   - Request hypervisor-level diagnostics

3. **Alternative Path**: Rebuild test-1.dev.nbg from Terraform and re-deploy via Ansible:
   ```bash
   # Backup current state (if accessible via console)
   # Destroy and recreate server
   cd terraform
   tofu destroy -target=hcloud_server.test_dev_nbg
   tofu apply
   cd ../ansible
   ansible-playbook playbooks/bootstrap.yaml --limit test-1.dev.nbg
   ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yaml --limit test-1.dev.nbg
   just ansible-deploy-env dev
   ```

4. **Short-term**: Implement external monitoring for all servers (SSH availability, ping response)
5. **Short-term**: Document server rebuild procedures in disaster_recovery.md for future incidents
6. **Medium-term**: Consider multi-server test environment to avoid single point of failure for DR testing
7. **Medium-term**: Add automated health checks before quarterly DR tests (SSH connectivity, Storage Box mount, restic repository accessibility)

---

### Issue 2: No Pre-Test Connectivity Validation

**Severity**: Medium (process gap)

**Impact**: Test execution attempted without validating prerequisites (SSH access), resulting in wasted time and incomplete test. Recovery testing plan (Section 5.4) lists "SSH access to mail-1.prod.nbg" as prerequisite but does not emphasize validating this BEFORE starting test timer. Test should have failed faster during pre-flight checks.

**Root Cause**: Recovery testing plan prerequisites section (Section 5.4) includes "SSH access" as a checkbox item, but does not specify that this should be validated with an actual connection test before proceeding. Test operator (Claude Code) reviewed documentation but did not verify connectivity before starting test execution timeline.

**Workaround Used**: None. Issue discovered during test execution when attempting first SSH command.

**Recommendation**:
1. Update recovery_testing_plan.md Section 5.4 to add explicit pre-flight validation step:
   ```markdown
   #### Pre-Flight Validation (DO THIS FIRST)

   Before starting test timer, validate all prerequisites:

   - [ ] **Test SSH connectivity**: `ssh root@test-1.dev.nbg 'date -u'` (should succeed)
   - [ ] **Verify Storage Box mounted**: `ssh root@test-1.dev.nbg 'mount | grep storagebox'`
   - [ ] **Verify restic accessible**: `ssh root@test-1.dev.nbg 'restic --version'`

   **If any validation fails, STOP and resolve blocker before proceeding with test.**
   ```
2. Add similar pre-flight validation to all test scenarios in recovery_testing_plan.md
3. Consider creating a pre-flight validation script/playbook that can be run before quarterly tests

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

**Positive aspects of test execution and recovery**:

- Documentation was comprehensive and clear (recovery_testing_plan.md Section 5.4 had detailed procedure)
- Test template (recovery_test_results_template.md) provided excellent structure for documenting results
- Hetzner Cloud CLI provided quick visibility into server status and remote management capabilities
- Previous test results (I5.T1) clearly documented expected state (2 snapshots, 3 files, ~21 MB data)
- Systematic troubleshooting approach identified blocker quickly (SSH timeout, server status check, firewall check, key verification)
- **Extended troubleshooting was thorough**: Attempted reboot, rescue mode, private network access - ruled out configuration issues
- **Proper escalation path identified**: Determined infrastructure-level issue requiring web console or support intervention
- Test failure was caught before any destructive actions were attempted (no data at risk)
- **Terraform/Ansible infrastructure-as-code provides rebuild path**: If server cannot be recovered, can be destroyed and recreated cleanly

---

### What Could Be Improved

**Areas for improvement in processes, tools, or practices**:

- **Pre-flight validation missing**: Test procedure should enforce connectivity checks before starting test timer
- **No fallback access method**: Test environment should have alternative access method (Hetzner Rescue, serial console, or VNC) for when SSH fails
- **No monitoring alerts**: SSH daemon failure did not trigger any alerts (no monitoring configured on test-1.dev.nbg)
- **Unclear "running" status**: Hetzner Cloud API reports server as "running" even when SSH is inaccessible, giving false confidence
- **No test environment health checks**: Should have automated daily/weekly health checks for test systems to catch issues before quarterly DR tests
- **Documentation assumes connectivity**: Recovery testing plan assumes SSH access will work, does not document what to do if connectivity fails during test

---

### Runbook Updates Needed

**Specific sections of runbooks that need updates**:

- [ ] **[recovery_testing_plan.md](../runbooks/recovery_testing_plan.md)**: Section 5.4 "Data Loss Recovery" - Add pre-flight validation checklist before test execution (validate SSH, Storage Box mount, restic access)

- [ ] **[recovery_testing_plan.md](../runbooks/recovery_testing_plan.md)**: All test scenarios (5.1-5.5) - Add pre-flight validation section at beginning of each scenario

- [ ] **[recovery_testing_plan.md](../runbooks/recovery_testing_plan.md)**: Section 10 "Safety Guidelines" - Add guidance for "What to do if test environment is unreachable" (use Hetzner reboot, Rescue system, etc.)

- [ ] **[disaster_recovery.md](../runbooks/disaster_recovery.md)**: Add new section "Troubleshooting SSH Access Issues" - Document steps for recovering access when SSH is unreachable (Hetzner reboot, Rescue mode, serial console)

- [ ] **[backup_verification.md](../runbooks/backup_verification.md)**: Section "Prerequisites" - Emphasize testing SSH connectivity before attempting backup verification procedures

**Rationale for each update**:
- Pre-flight validation prevents wasted time on tests that cannot succeed
- SSH troubleshooting procedures help operators recover from common access issues
- Adding "what to do when prerequisites fail" guidance makes runbooks more robust

---

### Process Changes

**Changes to procedures, workflows, or testing approach**:

- **Mandatory pre-flight checks**: All DR tests must validate prerequisites (especially SSH) before starting test execution timer
- **Test environment health monitoring**: Implement weekly automated health checks for test-1.dev.nbg (SSH access, Storage Box mount, restic repository accessibility)
- **Alternative access documentation**: Document how to use Hetzner Rescue system or server reboot for recovery when SSH fails
- **Quarterly test scheduling**: Schedule DR tests with advance notice to allow time for pre-test validation and issue resolution

---

### Knowledge Gaps Identified

**Information or skills that would have helped prevent issues or respond faster**:

- **Hetzner Rescue System**: Need to document how to boot test-1.dev.nbg into Rescue mode for troubleshooting when SSH fails
- **Serial console access**: Need to understand if Hetzner Cloud provides serial console access (or if only available via dedicated servers)
- **Server reboot impact**: Need to document whether rebooting test-1.dev.nbg will lose any data (ephemeral system, but Storage Box mount persistence unclear)
- **Network troubleshooting**: Need documented procedures for diagnosing network connectivity issues (traceroute, mtr, Hetzner network status)
- **SSH daemon recovery**: Need documented procedures for recovering SSH when it fails (Rescue mode, serial console, etc.)

## Recommendations

### For Next Test

**What to focus on or change in the next disaster recovery test**:

- **CRITICAL FIRST**: Restore test-1.dev.nbg via Hetzner Cloud Console or rebuild from Terraform before re-running test
- **Pre-test validation**: Run pre-flight validation checklist 48 hours before scheduled DR test to allow time for infrastructure-level issue resolution
- **Health check sequence**:
  1. Verify server "running" status: `hcloud server list | grep test-1`
  2. Test SSH connectivity from local machine: `ssh root@5.75.134.87 'date -u'`
  3. Test private network connectivity from mail-1: `ssh root@116.203.236.40 'ssh root@10.0.0.4 "date -u"'`
  4. Verify Storage Box mount: `ssh root@5.75.134.87 'mount | grep storagebox'`
  5. Verify restic repository: `ssh root@5.75.134.87 'restic snapshots'`
- **Complete I5.T5**: Re-execute full data loss recovery test following Section 5.4 procedure ONLY after all health checks pass
- **Document recovery path**: If server rebuild was required, document the Terraform destroy/apply process and how long it took
- **Consider alternative test environment**: If test-1 proves unreliable, consider testing on mail-1 (prod server) during low-traffic window

---

### For Production Readiness

**Improvements needed before relying on this procedure in production**:

- **Monitoring implementation**: Add uptime monitoring and SSH availability checks for all production systems (mail-1, syncthing-1)
- **Alternative access procedures**: Document and test Hetzner Rescue System procedures for emergency access when SSH fails
- **Automated health checks**: Implement daily automated checks for SSH access, Storage Box mount, restic repository health
- **Alerting system**: Set up alerts for SSH daemon failures, Storage Box mount failures, backup job failures
- **Runbook completeness**: Add "Troubleshooting SSH Access" section to disaster_recovery.md with step-by-step recovery procedures
- **Pre-flight validation**: Make prerequisite validation mandatory step before all DR tests and production recovery operations
- **Test environment reliability**: Test-1.dev.nbg should be stable enough for quarterly DR testing (current connectivity issue undermines test confidence)

## Test Review

**Test Reviewed By**: Self-reviewed

**Review Date**: 2025-10-30

**Review Notes**: Test execution was blocked by critical infrastructure failure on test-1.dev.nbg. Extensive troubleshooting was performed:
- ✅ SSH direct, Ansible, server status checks, firewall checks, key verification
- ✅ Server reboot (did NOT restore SSH)
- ✅ Rescue mode activation and reboot (rescue mode SSH ALSO failed - extremely unusual)
- ✅ Private network access attempt via mail-1 (also failed - proves not just public IP issue)
- ✅ Control test: mail-1 SSH works fine (proves local network and SSH key OK)

**Root Cause Determination**: Complete networking or SSH failure affecting BOTH public and private IPs, persisting through normal and rescue mode reboots. This is NOT a configuration issue - likely infrastructure-level failure (VM networking, hypervisor issue, or DDoS protection blocking port 22).

**Severity Escalation**: Initial diagnosis of "SSH daemon failure" has been escalated to "critical infrastructure failure" after extended troubleshooting ruled out all configuration-related causes. The fact that rescue mode (separate OS with default SSH config) ALSO cannot be reached via SSH indicates a severe infrastructure problem.

**Identified critical gaps**:
1. Recovery testing plan lacks pre-flight validation procedures (SSH connectivity should be verified 48h before test)
2. No monitoring/alerting for SSH daemon or server health (issue was only discovered during test execution)
3. No documented procedures for accessing servers via Hetzner Cloud Console when SSH fails
4. Test environment (test-1) has proven unreliable - consider using production server during low-traffic window for future DR tests

**Recommendation**: **CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED**:
1. Access test-1.dev.nbg via Hetzner Cloud Console (web VNC) to diagnose boot/network/SSH status
2. If console access fails or shows irrecoverable state, contact Hetzner Support (Server ID: 111301341) for hypervisor-level diagnostics
3. Alternative: Rebuild test-1 from Terraform (`tofu destroy/apply`) and re-deploy via Ansible
4. After test-1 restored/rebuilt, re-execute I5.T5 with pre-flight validation
5. Update recovery_testing_plan.md to add pre-flight validation and escalation procedures

**Approval Status**: Final (documents infrastructure failure blocking test execution, awaiting test-1 recovery before I5.T5 can be re-attempted)
