# Documentation

## Purpose
This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the infrastructure project, supporting the ongoing refactoring effort to improve modularity, testability, and operational excellence.

## Contents
- **diagrams/** - Architecture diagrams (PlantUML, Mermaid, C4 model)
- **runbooks/** - Operational procedures and playbooks for deployment, rollback, disaster recovery
- **schemas/** - Validation schemas for secrets, configurations, and infrastructure state
- **refactoring/** - Analysis reports, test results, and iteration summaries for the refactoring project
- **reference/** - Reference documentation (existing)

## Usage
This documentation supports both day-to-day operations and the multi-iteration refactoring project. Refer to specific subdirectories for detailed information about architecture, procedures, and validation rules.

## Standards
- Use Markdown format for all documentation
- Follow 2-space indentation for nested lists
- Keep diagrams as code (PlantUML/Mermaid) for version control
- Update runbooks whenever operational procedures change
